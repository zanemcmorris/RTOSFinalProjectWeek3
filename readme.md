CHANGES:

- Created satchel macro (just a little box). Physics and display updates for up to MAX_SATCHELS
- Reduced platform constant physics significantly and fixed capsense not wanting to work correctly
- Refactoed constants into a mutable_consts struct and made init function to assign default and required values

PROJECT COMPLETION: (7.5) + 4.5 hrs / 36.75 = 32.6% finished.

ANALYSIS OF TIME ESTIMATES VS LOGS Environment Variables: Estimated time - 2 hrs | Real time - 3 hrs | 1.5x time estimate Slug based on pos: Estimated time - .5 hrs | Real time - 2 hrs | 4.0x time estimate Starting on physics: Estimated time - 2 hrs | Real time - 2 hrs | 1.0x time estimate Weekly upkeep: estimated time - 3.5hrs / 5 weeks = .70 hrs/week | Real time - .25 hrs | 0.35x time estimate

Satchel based on position: Estimated time - .5 hrs | Real time - 1.5 hrs  | 3x
Environment variable tweeking : Estimated time - 2hrs | Real time- .5 hrs | .25x
Platform based on position: Estimated time - 3 hrs | Real time - 1 hr (Nearly complete) | .33x
Weekly upkeep: Estimated time - .70 hrs | Real time - .5 | 0.7x

STATUS: I had a really tough schedule this week and I did as much work as possible that wouldn't have compimised my other classes. I plan to spend a lot of time this weekend knocking stuff out so that I will be less worried about it as finals begin to get closer. I clarified the purpose of the capsense control of the platform with Jon and I have practically finished that functionality. I still need to implement the shield, shooting of the railgun, energy storage, polishing castle drawing, and game logic. I think my estimate is actually looking pretty good, if not over, right now because I was able to get into the zone repeatedly over the past week and work very efficiently, but that being said, I still need to dedicate more time towards the project. Unfortunately burnout this week is very strong.
